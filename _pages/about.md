Mingjun Zhong is a Senior Lecturer in Machine Learning at the School of Computer Science at the moment. (I am soon moving to the University of Aberdeen on the 1st June.) 
I am interested in application-driven machine learning. I am particularly interested in machine learning for healthcare and energy. I have been working on Bayesian inference including variational inferential algorithms and Markov chain Monte Carlo for problems for example matrix factorization, Raman spectra data, household energy, and medical imaging data. I have developed deep learning algorithms for example sequence-to-point learning for non-intrusive load monitoring (energy disaggregation).
