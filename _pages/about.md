Mingjun Zhong is a Lecturer in Machine Learning at the Department of Computing Science in the University of Aberdeen. My research interests are mainly (application-driven) machine learning and computational statistics. My research mission is to understand patterns and phenomena observed in real-world data by devising probabilistic and statistical machine learning methodologies.

I have been working on the following directions with machine learning:
1. Ambulance data.
1. Non-intrusive load monitoring (energy disaggregation).
1. Spectroscopy data.
1. EEG and fMRI.
1. Variational inference
1. Markov chain Monte Carlo.

In the foreseen future, I will be particularly focusing on machine learning for health care data and energy.
