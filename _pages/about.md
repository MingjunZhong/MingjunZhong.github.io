Mingjun Zhong is a Senior Lecturer in Machine Learning at the School of Computer Science in the University of Lincoln at the moment. (I am soon moving to the University of Aberdeen on the 1st June.) My research interests are mainly (application-driven) machine learning and computational statistics. My research mission is to understand patterns and phenomena observed in real-world data by devising probabilistic and statistical machine learning methodologies.

I have been working on the following directions with machine learning:
1. Ambulance data.
1. Non-intrusive load monitoring (energy disaggregation).
1. Spectroscopy data.
1. EEG and fMRI.
1. Variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo.

In the foreseen future, I will be particularly focusing on machine learning for health care data and energy.
